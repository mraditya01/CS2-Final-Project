# CS2-Final-Project
The goal of this project report is to run a program which use a spatial database to
display, save, load, and search the coordinate of places in Nagoya University. The program
will be split into several source code, main_menu.c, database.c, page.c, and readline.c, and
several headers, item.h, readline.h, and database.h. The code readline.c and readline.h is
based on the book "C Programming, A Modern Approach 2nd ed." (written by K. N. King).
